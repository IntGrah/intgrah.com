                        By no means was Liszt a first-rate pianist and a
                        second-rate composer. It is true that his identity was
                        first established as a peripatetic virtuoso, but this
                        largely receded during the second half of his life.
                        Persuaded by his mistress Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein,
                        he embraced a career as a composer rather than that of a
                        performer, never performing by necessity but by free
                        will, if that exists. The B minor sonata was written in
                        a time interval which saw this change in his career, and
                        it turned out to be the only self-sufficient sonata he
                        would write. difficult pieces for the stage.

                        The initial reception of this sonata was negative, which
                        was to be expected of contemporary music. Has the
                        premi√®re of a 21th century avant-garde work ever escaped
                        violent criticism? Clara Schumann denounced it as a{" "}
                        <q>blind noise</q>, and Brahms allegedly fell asleep
                        when Liszt performed it himself. It has become one of
                        the most studied works of piano literature, a claim
                        supplemented by this short article. Popular speculation
                        associates this sonata with the legend of Faust, a
                        scholar who makes a pact with the devil for infinite
                        knowledge and power. However, this probably satisfies
                        only those who feel that the work needs a programmatic
                        explanation. I do not &mdash; it is enough to see that
                        the way a piece is crafted is a sufficient basis for
                        art.

                        Liszt&apos;s economy of thematic material is
                        indispensable to the double-function form of this piece.
                        Despite being a continuous piece of music, its distinct
                        movements are clearly identifiable: a short sonata form,
                        slow movement, scherzo-fugue, and finale. Yet we can
                        still see the usual sonata-allegro form encompassing the
                        whole piece. Brilliant motivic transformation is what
                        brings out this dual structure.

                        If Bach is an astronomer, and Beethoven is a challenger,
                        then I claim Liszt is a sorcerer. We are immediately
                        presented with an astonishing start to a half-hour
                        sonata, if it is obvious that it is a sonata at all.
                        Ominous timpano (singular, because there is only one
                        note!) strikes followed by descending scales. In what
                        tonal world can we describe ourselves in? The astute and
                        knowledgeable observer should recognise that these
                        scales are the Phrygian and Hungarian modes of the scale
                        of G. However, the last notes of the scales missing. It
                        should be reminded that this piece is in B minor &mdash;
                        at the very least, this descending scale theme is easy
                        to recognise (indeed, Liszt uses it as a sort of
                        structural glue, acting like a leitmotif within an
                        opera). By some miracle, the first root position B minor
                        chord appears almost two minutes in, and the listener is
                        certainly going to be reminded of it in the
                        recapitulation. Some pianists are tempted to add a
                        bottom B to emphasise this recapitulation when it comes,
                        as it is the only section repeated verbatim, although
                        Leslie Howard might slap you on the wrist for it.
                        Careful examination reveals that Liszt avoids using the
                        bottom B of the piano through the entire piece except at
                        one place. It would be all the wiser to adhere to this
                        restraint.

                        In the manuscript, the piece was supposed to end with a
                        barrage of noisy chords, until Liszt thought better of
                        it. Instead, an intelligently positioned reminiscence
                        back to the second <q>movement</q>. The final cadence is
                        a tritone leap from F major to B minor, the furthest key
                        change possible, up to enharmonic equivalence. It is
                        incredible that such harmony is possible, but in fact,
                        it has already appeared six times throughout,
                        conditioning the listener and thus enabling this
                        impossible cadence. On the final note of the piece we
                        get the only occurrence of the bottom B on the piano: a
                        conclusive resolution of this scalic theme, which
                        finally completes the 8 note scale.
